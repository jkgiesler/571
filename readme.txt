Article processing example shows the different steps of processing articles.

Raw stream example is an example of a raw stream from twitter based on keywords.

Example data is a folder which has a bunch of data I used for debugging and generating the graphs.

The code directory has examples of how to use python for twitter streaming, searching old tweets, extracting article text from a website, and natural language processing. One example shows filtering streaming tweets by geolocation, the other is filtering tweets by keyword. There is also a small script for interfacing with instagram, if we are interested in looking there too.

This code is pretty rough. I wrote most of it in an afternoon, or copied and pasted it from other projects. I like writing stuff to text files for debugging.

If you want to run this code you will need to register a twitter/instagram account and get your own private keys.

Happiness vs GDP contains some analysis for another component of the project.
