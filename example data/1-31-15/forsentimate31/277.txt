A program from the "Climate One" series produced by the Commonwealth Club of California. The speakers suggest that most Americans have "ecological systems blindness," because the human brain is designed for survival by responding to immediate danger, not to long-term risks.

Speakers are Daniel Goleman, Joshua Freedman, George Lakoff, George Marshall, Dacher Keltner, Deepak Chopra and Rinaldo Brutoco. Moderator is Greg Dalton.
