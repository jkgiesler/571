The largest rally against fracking in California history is coming up on February 7th: The March for Real Climate Leadership. Whether or not you can join us in person, we need you to sign the petition demanding Governor Jerry Brown end fracking in California now, so we can deliver your demands right to his doorstep in Oakland!

Last month, New York's governor took an historic step by completely outlawing fracking â€“ now it's California's turn. But while Gov. Brown laid out bold plans to address climate change in his recent inaugural address, he made ZERO mention of the extreme dangers that fracking has to the health and safety of our communities. THIS is a game-changing moment for the climate movement in California.

SIGN THE PETITION to Gov. Brown right now and say:

"We must take swift action to stop climate change from inflicting catastrophic damage in California and elsewhere. California can't claim to be a global leader in the fight against climate change while also allowing Big Oil to frack the state and release millions of tons of carbon and methane into the air that climate scientists agree must stay inside the earth. This is even before you factor in how fracking endangers the health of our communities, poisons our scarce water supplies, and increases the risk of earthquakes. I ask that you follow through on your promise to confront climate change, be a REAL climate leader, and put an end to fracking in California now."
