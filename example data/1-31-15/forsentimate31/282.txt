Agriculture and Nutrition /

The marketplace is the most effective place for making dietary changes. The urban poor and even rural families who work in agriculture make choices based on what is available in the market. Despite working on crop-yielding farms, many agricultural families are undernourished and often hungry.

Food systems are under pressure from the continuing shift of people to cities, which rely on commercial channels for food.

Climate change has an impact on the availability of nutrients in the food system, potentially requiring shifts to more heat-tolerant grains.

In light of these challenges, we need to modify the agricultural supply chain to increase the amount and diversity of nutrients in a range of foods. From seed choices and growing techniques to food processing, farmers and entrepreneurs can make choices and employ new technologies to make more food more nutritious.
