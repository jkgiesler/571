After the world stood still to hear the pleas of activist Leonardo DiCaprio at the UN climate change summit, he has once again grabbed headlines with his green endeavors. The wolf opened his pockets to the tune of 42 million dollars in a donation to project ocean 5 helping protect large areas of the Arctic.

The environmental conservationist and messenger of world peace went on to say “The sad truth is that less than two percent of our oceans are fully protected. We need to change that now”.

This is one of many donations the star has made this year to fund protection against the effects of climate change. He pledged $7million earlier this year in June, then shortly after hosted a gala to raise funds in excess of $25 million, with stars such as Bono and Robin Thicke in attendance for the foundation he established in 1998.

Last year the foundation awarded a $3 million grant to the World Wildlife Fund to help Nepal increase its tiger population and raised $38.8 million through donations and an art auction at Christie’s in New York.

In a statement he made announcing his intended contributions, DiCaprio said that he considers it a “sad truth” that no more than two percent of the oceans have full protection and he said that a change is needed right now.
