A new New York Times/Stanford University poll finds an overwhelming majority of the American public, including nearly half of Republicans, support government action to curb global warming.

“In a finding that could have implications for the 2016 presidential campaign, the poll also found that two-thirds of Americans say they are more likely to vote for political candidates who campaign on fighting climate change. They are less likely to vote for candidates who question or deny the science of human-caused global warming.”
