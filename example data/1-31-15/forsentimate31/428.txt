Brownsea Island in Dorset. The UK will see wetter, milder winters and hotter, drier summers due to global warming

Weather will become both too wet and too dry – and also too cold and too hot – as climate change increases the frequency of extreme events. But the natural year-to-year variability of weather will also mean occasional very cold winters, like that of 2010-11, and very wet summers, like that of 2012. Recent years have seen highly variable weather in the UK with a drought in early 2012 and the greatest deluge for 250 years and widespread flooding over the winter of 2013-14
