Britain has entered an energy crisis as EDF close down four nuclear energy reactors for safety reasons. With the full implications of this measure yet to be understood, initial fears have left the energy grid sourcing emergency supplies to facilitate Britainâ€™s demand for electricity.

The defect on a boiler spine was found at a reactor at its Heysham 1 plant in Lancashire and shut it in June. Further issues the arose as they then shut down the second reactor at Heysham 1 and two at their Hartlepool site. With speculations growing over how long the repairs may take, the company have now announced that works will go on to resolve the issues as late as December this year. In order for service to be resumed, a full inspection of all defects and cracks will commence, putting pressure on the engineers to get it right first time.

The issues over energy have given further rise to renewable energy protesters who have suggested that solar, turbine and bio energy forms could feed into the grid, however as thing stand, the uK has failed to invest enough in green energy to carry the burden.
