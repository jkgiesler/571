Climate Change

It's incredibly important to document the changes that mark a difference in the climate. It's completely necessary to note changes such as ocean tides rising, glaciers melting, animal species threatened or going extinct. Also to note what changes are caused by man alone, and what are a result of changes in the planet. This is not an absolute science, but it is changing and it is news, that much is indisputable.
