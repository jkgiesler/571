Small island states like Seychelles are, more than many other countries, on the receiving end of climate change. However, too often the response is reduced to wringing our hands and cursing our fate. Rather than react we believe we should be anticipating.

Nature Seychelles sees climate change as a challenge to be tackled in creative ways as well as an opportunity. Itâ€™s an opportunity to innovate, to redress past mistakes, to mainstream certain issues and to adapt to an inevitable changing of times.

Our adaptation projects have been game-changers. The Cousin Island Carbon Neutral Initiative has awakened the entire conservation world to the seductive possibilities of carbon trading, supporting projects in other countries, and in alleviating the eco-footprint concerns of international tourists to developing world destinations. Our Reef Rescuers project moved a never-ending discussion as well as a long running research agenda on coral bleaching to real action where corals are being grown and transplanted to damaged sites.

Our current and planned climate-related projects include:

Impacts of climate change on populations of Hawksbill turtles in Seychelles. Community Climate Centre for Seychelles. Reef Rescuers
