Climate change is an existential threat for the region, stated Irwin LaRoque, general secretary of the Caribbean Community (Caricom).

The phenomena related to the rise of the sea level, rise of temperature of oceans and the more frequent and intense climate phenomena mean a struggle for our survival, said in the annual meeting of awards of the Association of Guyana Manufacturing Services.

LaRoque emphasized that the community is working to increase resilience among its member states because of the estimate impact of the climate change phenomenon are ‘sobering’.

After listing the possible consequences of even the smallest changes in climatic conditions, the diplomat reasoned that an increase of two degrees in global temperature will cause serious adverse effects, eg on water resources, agriculture, tourism, fishing industry and public health.

A one-meter rise in sea level will affect our coastal communities and will trigger negative economic impacts of hundreds of billions of dollars, he argued.

On this basis, he stressed that Caricom is focused on building its resistance against the climate change and extreme weather phenomena in order to provide a viable and safety society for the inhabitants of the region.
