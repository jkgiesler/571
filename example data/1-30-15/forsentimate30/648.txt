A Visual Guide to Home Energy Savings

Summers have been hot lately. Real hot. For many people, it’s a struggle to stay cool and comfortable during the hottest months of the year. For others, it’s a struggle to keep yourself from over-indulging.

Those of us who are fortunate enough to have air-conditioned homes must resist annual temptation to crank that sucker down to 71 and stay happy… and dry. Those of us that can’t resist the urge? Yeah, we’re broke. Air conditioning is not a happy addition to your monthly power bill, and it doesn’t take too many 100 degree days to make a very nasty impact on your household budget.

Luckily, there are ways to prevent that cool air from escaping the walls of your home too quickly, and thus keep your AC unit from switching on too often. Have a look at these simple measures you can take that will make a world of difference.
