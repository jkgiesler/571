Unabashed one-two punch of leftism comes from mayor of Bridgeport as he publicly thanks Al Sharpton for fighting global warming.

"Thank you for your show, reverend, you’ve been fighting the good fight on climate change, and we can see the crazy climate here, and we’d like to have a little bit more of you down in Washington."



Mayor has been receiving aggressive correspondence from rightfully indignant citizens across the country.



Even when there was plenty of Al Sharpton to go around, no normal humans wanted even a fraction of a mitochondria of his existence, Mayor. Here’s to hoping Bridgeport wises up next election.
