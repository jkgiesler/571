Robert O. Keohane is professor of international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. In presenting the James Madison Award to Professor Keohane, the citation noted “Keohane is the complete scholar: he has written extensively in the field of international politics, creating a field around himself; he has educated and mentored generations of students, especially women; and he has served the discipline, both through his many years of departmental service but also through his long commitment to the association. Keohane is a scholar of international politics whose work focuses on the determinants of cooperation between nations and within international organizations. His most-cited work, After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy, asked whether and how nations can agree to solve common problems in a world lacking a leading power.” He can be reached at rkeohane@princeton.edu.
