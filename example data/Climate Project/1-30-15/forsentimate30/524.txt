Icebergs Make a Signature Crunch as They're Born

As glaciers calve and create an iceberg, a characteristic sound is made that can be recorded in order to describe the event, according to new research. For example, a chunk of ice pulling away underwater sounds different than one that's sliding down the face of a glacier.

Researchers say they may be able to use submarine microphones in this way to help gauge the speed of melting glaciers due to climate change.

The new findings come from a group of scientists in Poland, the United States and the UK who studied the Hans Glacier in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean.

"Using acoustics, we can get very accurate data and we can collect this data continuously," Oskar Glowacki, from the Institute of Geophysics at the Polish Academy of Sciences, told the BBC. "We just place the hydrophones -- underwater microphones -- in the water and listen to the sounds."

The researchers combined the recordings with time-lapse photography of icebergs at the moment of their creation (see video, above).

"The ice block detaches from the ice wall and it starts to appear on the surface," Glowacki said. "And using underwater acoustics, we can identify all stages of this sound."
