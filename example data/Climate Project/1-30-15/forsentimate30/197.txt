President Obama has promised to veto the Keystone Pipeline bill if the Senate passes it this week. But that may not stop the new Republican Congress.



Right now, the Senate needs only four more votes to override the President's veto. When it comes to stopping this climate-killing pipeline, we can't afford to take any chances. Sign here to tell your Senators to sustain the veto and stop Keystone XL pipeline for good.
