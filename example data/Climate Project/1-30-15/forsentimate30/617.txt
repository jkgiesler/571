Maher Rips GOP on Climate: What do You have against listening to Scientists ?



Bill Maher tonight tackled Republican climate denial and asked what exactly they have against listening to the overwhelming consensus of over ten thousand climate scientists. He brought up a study showing those thousands of scientists agree on manmade climate change, compared to two who don’t.



Bret Stephens argued that climate fearmongering has been going on for a while, but Maher dismissed that as another Republican talking point. He brought up that study and asked, “Doesn’t that persuade you? The idea of scientific consensus? Don’t you think scientists know more about science than we do?”



Stephens shot back that scientists don’t know that much about public policy. Maher said it’s “hubris” to spit in the face of so much scientific consensus, while Stephens insisted, “Consensus should not rule science.”
