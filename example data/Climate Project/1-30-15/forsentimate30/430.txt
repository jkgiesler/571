As the climate crisis has intensified, researchers have warned repeatedly in recent years about the consequences of rising sea levels. Those warnings took a turn earlier this month when scholars, relying on new measurement methods, pointed to evidence that sea levels have risen “dramatically faster over the last two decades than anyone had known.”

Today, Juliet Eilperin reports that the Obama administration is taking new steps to incorporate rising sea levels into all federal projects.

P resident Obama will issue an executive order Friday directing federal agencies – as well as state and local governments drawing on federal funds – to adopt stricter building and siting standards to reflect scientific projections that future flooding will be more frequent and intense due to climate change.
