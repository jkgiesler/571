The Security and Sustainability Forum (SSF) is a public interest organization that produces learning events about climate security, defined as the threats to society from a changing climate and related disruptions to natural systems. SSF products include free webinars that convene global experts on food and water security, pubic health, economic vitality, infrastructure, governance, and other impacts that must be solved in meeting climate security challenges.



SSF is a place for industry, government, academics, and others interested in the environmental impacts that threaten security. Participants to SSF events learn from the global technical experts and decision makers about new and ongoing programs to address and adapt to climate change. Participants also gain insight into where governments and industry are investing to promote community resiliency, clean energy and resource security, and how they plan to protect nations from natural and man made threats.
