Tell your legislator to support a coal to clean energy transition in Oregon! Oregonians recognize that it’s better for our state to create good-paying local solar and wind energy jobs that can support families than it is for us to send our money to out-of-state coal plants.



That's why 71% of Oregon voters support an upcoming legislative proposal to transition the state off coal to clean, renewable energy by 2025.



Coal plants are the single biggest air polluter in the US and one of the leading causes of climate change. Overall, Oregon still gets one-third of its energy from coal, much of that coming from out-of-state coal plants. Pacific Power, Oregon's second biggest utility company, gets two-thirds of its energy from coal plants.



We've defeated four coal export proposals in the region, and Oregon's only coal plant – PGE's Boardman plant – will stop burning coal in 2020. Yet coal-powered electricity still makes up about one quarter of Oregon's total carbon footprint. We can do better. Instead of buying coal from out-of-state plants, Oregon's utility companies should invest in clean, renewable energy sources — like wind and solar — that create new jobs locally and protect our climate.
