FactCheck.org has launched a new feature, "SciCheck," authored by a new writer, Dave Levitan, to check science-based claims. Levitan has been a science writer for the past 10 years with some of our favorite outlets: Inside Climate News, Grist, Yale Environment360, etc.

The inaugural SciCheck looks at recent claims made by Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, two potential GOP presidential candidates. Santorum wrongly claimed US efforts to reduce emissions won't make a difference, while Huckabee jokingly suggested all we have to worry about from climate change is a sunburn. Both claims are thoroughly debunked.

Speaking of debunking, a new study in Nature shows how the deniers' claims that models are too hot are "unfounded." Researchers looked at 15-year trends from 1900 to 2012 and were able to show that the average observed trend (0.086°C/decade) and the model average trend (0.088°C/decade) are in close agreement. LA Times and Carbon Brief both have great stories on the study.

While this should be yet another nail in the coffin of "the pause," we have no doubt that when confronted with the significance of this study the deniers will…well, deny it.
