While name-calling rarely settles an argument, at times it can illuminate and clarify. With that in mind, we believe professor Richard Lindzen did the right thing identifying global-warming alarmists as members of a "cult."

"As with any cult, once the mythology of the cult begins falling apart, instead of saying, 'Oh, we were wrong,' they get more and more fanatical. I think that's what's happening here," said Lindzen, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology climate scientist.

"Think about it. You've led an unpleasant life, you haven't led a very virtuous life, but now you're told you get absolution if you watch your carbon footprint. It's salvation!"

Lindzen's remarks were reported on Breitbart News by author and radio talk show host Howie Carr. For further illumination and solid reasoning, go directly to the piece here.
