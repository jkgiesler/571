Walt Disney presents…the exciting new “Frozen” spin-off, “Climate Change?”

If an Obama administration official has his way, the studio responsible for the highest grossing animated film of all time will use the movie’s characters to teach children about the impact of a warming planet on the polar bear.

“I said, ‘You’ve taught an entire generation about the Arctic,’” said Robert Papp, the State Department’s envoy for the Arctic, in recalling the meeting he had with a Disney executive. “Unfortunately, the Arctic that you’ve taught them is a fantasy kingdom in Norway, where everything is nice.”

“Nice” can’t be too bad, considering the 2013 musical about a fearless princess who journeys alongside a Norwegian iceman and pet reindeer to find her sister, who has trapped the kingdom in eternal winter with her icy powers, has racked up two Academy Awards and more than $1.072 billion at the box office.

“And I said what we really need to do is educate the American youth about the plight of the polar bear, about the thawing tundra, about Alaskan villages that run the risk of falling into the sea because of the lack of sea ice protecting their shores,” Papp said.

Not surprisingly, Disney’s not keen on the idea because they prefer more “optimistic stories.” That’s not deterring Papp, though, who has seen “Frozen” 20 times because of his two granddaughters and thinks that his idea is worth, um, “melting for.”

“We’re regrouping on our story line and we still have Disney engaged,” he said. “But there’s more yet to come there.”

Here’s hoping he never lets this idea go.
