Scotland awards £2.86m to tackle climate change

Community-led projects in Scotland aimed at tackling climate change have been awarded £2.86 million.

It is part of the Climate Challenge Fund, which provides funding for community projects that contribute towards the transition to a low carbon economy.

Winners include the Glasgow Nepalese Association, which will provide home energy efficiency advice and community workshops and the McLaren Community Centre, which will cut its energy use and carbon emissions through roof insulation and lighting improvements.

Scotland’s Climate Change Minister Aileen McLeod said: “Climate change is one of the most serious challenges to global society and the natural environment both at home and abroad.

“Some of the best initiatives to reduce carbon are devised and delivered at a local level.”
