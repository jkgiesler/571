>: HEY-HEY, BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY HERE.

2

RECENTLY I'VE BEEN CONFUSED WITH ANOTHER BILL, BILL BELICHICK.

3

HE AND HIS QUARTERBACK, TOM BRADY, CLAIMED THAT THE REASON

4

THE FOOTBALLS FELT ESPECIALLY SOFT--

5

THAT BALL SEEMS A LITTLE SOFT TO ME.

6

--WAS DUE TO NATURAL WEATHER CONDITIONS THERE AT THE FOOTBALL FIELD.

7

LETS SAY THAT THESE FOOTBALLS WERE INFLATED IN A BACK ROOM,

8

WHERE THERE'S BIG SWEATY FOOTBALL PLAYERS MOVING AROUND,

9

(he grunts and growls)

10

LET'S SAY IT WAS 80 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, THE TEMPERATURE

11

PLUMMETED TO A 51 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

12

IT'S PROBABLY COLDER THAN THAT WHERE YOU ARE NOW.

13

IF WE CHANGE THAT JUST 30 DEGREES YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT A 6% PERCENT CHANGE,

14

IF YOU'RE OFF BY A FACTOR OF 2 AND A HALF,

15

BUT ONE TEST IS WORTH A 1000 EXPERT OPINIONS,

16

SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FOOTBALLS AND PUT'EM

17

IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

18

WE'VE SET THE REFRIGERATOR TO 51 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

19

THAT'S TOO WARM FOR FOOD. IT WOULD ALL SPOIL,

20

>: (MALE VOICE): GROSS!

>: (BILL): BUT THIS MY FRIENDS IS SCIENCE.

21

22

WHILE WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES HERE, I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

23

CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.

24

WHILE WE'RE ALL OBSESSED WITH DEFLATEGATE LET'S KEEP IN MIND

25

THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT WHICH YOU SHOULD GIVE A (bleep).

26

YES, LIKE TOM BRADY THE WORLDS GETTING HOTTER AND HOTTER,

27

AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE WE HUMANS ARE PUMPING CARBON

28

DIOXIDE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, EVERY TIME WE BURN FOSSIL FUELS,

29

AND WE BURN GASOLINE IN OUR CARS, AND WHEN TOM BRADY AND BILL BELICHICK

30

START TALKING FOR 2 AND HALF HOURS AT PRESS CONFERENCES

31

SPEWING OUT CARBON DIOXIDE MAKING CLIMATE CHANGE THAT MUCH WORSE.

32

WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT THIS?

33

YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR CONGRESSMEN AND SENATORS THAT APPRECIATE THE

34

THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE RATE THAT THE WORLD IS GETTING WARMER,

35

SO THAT WE CAN PRESERVE THE EARTH FOR HUMAN KIND FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

36

(bell rings)

37

UH...

38

39

WE JUST GOT THIS BALL OUT OF THE FRIDGE, AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

40

I THINK THE PATRIOTS PROBABLY BENT THE RULES A LITTLE BIT,

41

A SEEMINGLY INSIGNIFICANT THING,

42

BUT I DO WANT TO CLOSE WITH THIS,

43

GO SEAHAWKS.
