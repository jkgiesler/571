Two friends, Mr Donoti and Mr Noel, have an appointment to meet for a drink in a bar somewhere on the northern hemisphere during the month of July. Mr Donoti is first to arrive. He is sitting in a typical local bar, holding a glass and a cigarette, and is waiting for his close friend Mr Noel to arrive. Although it is summer, it is pouring with rain outside, and it feels cold. Dark clouds have covered the city. Watching the stormy weather outside, Mr Donoti knows this is only the start of something much worse, but his thoughts are disrupted by the arrival of Mr Noel. Following a discussion with Mr Donoti while having a drink at the bar, Mr Noel is shocked to learn what the true consequences of global warming are.
