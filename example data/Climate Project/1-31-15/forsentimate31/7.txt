Climate Change As A Game

They may not be calling it a game, but a climate simulator has been made available so people can see the consequences by playing with the variables in the news: energy input, output, and sources. Everyone has a different interpretation of energy needs, the likelihood of various options, and the willingness of others to alter their habits. Don’t take someone else’s word for what might happen. Run your own analysis, and play with it to see how much it may change.
