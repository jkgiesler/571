As a region of small-island developing states, the Caribbean has always faced a host of challenges, including limited infrastructure, reliance on agriculture and tourism, and high vulnerability to natural disasters. But in recent years, climate change has superimposed another layer of risk, bringing sea level rise, flooded wetlands, higher temperatures, changes in precipitation and more intense hurricanes, and threatening coral reefs and fish stocks. Much of the worldâ€™s most interesting work in adapting to climate change, adopting clean energy and coming up with plans to stem deforestation has its roots in the developing world, where climate change impacts are in many cases being felt first and strongest. IPS looks at the wide variety of local, national and regional initiatives in the Caribbean that offer creative solutions to these problems. Key will be better natural resource management, and giving small farmers and rural communities the tools to climb out of poverty and feed a growing population even as climate change disrupts their environment.
