Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, gave UCAR's Walter Orr Roberts Distinguished Lecture on Friday, September 5 in Chautauqua Auditorium on the Chautauqua campus. Recently named to TIME magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World list for 2014, Katharine Hayhoe is an atmospheric scientist who studies climate change and what it means for people and the natural environment. But Hayhoe may be best-known to the general public because of how she's bridging the broad, deep gap between scientists and conservative Christians — work she does in part because she's a conservative Christian herself.



Together with her husband Andrew Farley, a professor of applied linguistics and best-selling author of "The Naked Gospel," Hayhoe wrote "A Climate for Change: Global Warming Facts for Faith-Based Decisions," a book that untangles the complex science and tackles many long-held misconceptions about global warming.



Hayhoe’s work as a climate change evangelist is featured on the documentary series "Years of Living Dangerously" and "The Secret Life of Scientists and Engineers," and in articles appearing in On Earth, Grist, the LA Times, Climate Progress, and others. In 2012 she was honored to be named one of Christianity Today’s 50 Women to Watch.
