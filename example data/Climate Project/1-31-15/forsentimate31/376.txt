The left has a real problem prioritizing. Instead of focusing on the economy and national debt, they obsess over non-existent racism, “word choice” and climate change. (Which, by the way, is an absurd term. Obviously the climate changes. That’s the nature of climate.)

In fact, the left seems more frightened by the thought of man made climate change than Islamic terrorists.

But liberals see humans as a virus on the earth– a virus that’s damaging the beautiful and serene planet that would be much better off without us.

Members of the Obama administration constantly quote the scientific consensus on global warming that “99 percent of scientists agree,” even though it’s been debunked. The entire “consensus” was based on questionable research methods and manipulated statistics and questions.

And let’s be real. They can’t even predict the 10 day forecast correctly and they expect us to believe their claims about anthropogenic climate change? Yeah, right.
