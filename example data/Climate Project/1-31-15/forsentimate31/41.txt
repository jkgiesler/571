A whole bunch of private jets descended on Davos, Switzerland this week (Jon Stewart cited 1,700, but that number has been downgraded by some to account for normal air traffic in Davos. Still way more private jets than your average person deals with on a weekly basis) so their well-heeled passengers could attend the World Economic Forum and discuss income inequality and climate change. Stewart found this to be a tad silly, and went on to make fun of the entire event and the businesses of those present on Thursday night's Daily Show.

Watch until the end to get a brief taste of what it might be like if Snoop Dogg worked on Wall Street in 2008.

Correction: The 1,700 number cited by Jon Stewart has been downgraded by some who questioned the original sum; we updated the post with a link to the article explaining the jet math.
