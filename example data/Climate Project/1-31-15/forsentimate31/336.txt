Last week we reported that ski resorts were closing due to low snow levels. This week we have gotten news that more ski resorts are suspending operations due to the unseasonably dry conditions.

California and Oregon seem to be the hardest hit this season. California is experiencing its fourth year of extreme and exceptional drought. Snowfall this season has been measured at just 33% of average. Resorts that have not flat out closed are holding on by the skin of their teeth. Homewood Ski Resort in Lake Tahoe, CA has shut down all but two bunny hill rope tows and are are essentially closed.
