Brooklyn, NY Share this event:



Since 1818, farmers have relied on the Farmers' Almanac for homey wit and uncannily accurate weather predictions to inform their planting, harvesting, and day-to-day living. In 2015, Slow Food New York City, continuing a Food Systems Network NYC tradition, will sponsor the fifth annual Food Almanac, a food and farming prognostication inspired by the Farmers' Almanac.



This is a singular opportunity for food-active individuals to consider all things food and farming in 2015. A panel of farmers, scientists, and policymakers will speculate on an incredibly important aspect of food and farming - "Climate Change, Agriculture, and Resilience." Attendees will enjoy local wines & beers accompanied by seasonal snacks, so while the topic is sobering, not all will be food for thought!
