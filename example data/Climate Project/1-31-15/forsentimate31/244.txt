This is an amended version of the video I did for BraveNewClimate - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuRk-J....

In the 1970s, two countries took two different paths in energy policy. Denmark pursued wind power, but failed to replace its fossil fuel power plants. It has among the highest carbon emissions per capita in Europe. France pursued nuclear power, and now has among the lowest carbon emissions of any OECD country. Lesson learned. Nuclear power mitigates carbon emissions and fights climate change. Renewable energy, by itself, is inadequate. If you want real climate action, you must support both nuclear energy and renewables. It's the only way to solve the climate problem, fully, and in time to make a real difference.
